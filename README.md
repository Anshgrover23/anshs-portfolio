## Email Subscription (Brevo) Setup

1. Copy the environment template and fill in your keys:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local 
```

2. Set the following variables in `.env.local`:

```env
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
```

Note:
- `BREVO_API_KEY` is required for the `/api/subscribe` endpoint to work.
